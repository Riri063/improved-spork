'''WHAT IS PYTHON?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.

Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently 
where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions 
than other languages.

Programming is basically writing instruction for a computer to perform a task.

Storing and sharing of information both within and outside the program/code

DATA TYPES:
1. Numbers
2. String
3. List
4. Tuple
5. Dictionary

# NUMBERS
Basically Numeric values and are of 3 types:
Python supports integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers.

integer: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or even negative numbers ==> int
floating point: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 or even negative numbers ==> float
complex numbers: 1+2j, 2+3j, 3+4j, 4+5j, 5+6j, or even negative numbers ==> complex
string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes ('')
or double quotes ("") or triple quotes () or tripple double quote.
Strings are immutable
# List
# A list is a collection of items which is ordered and changeable.
# It is created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets [].
# It allows storing multiple values in a single variable.
# A list can contain items of different data types.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', [], 10.09, 12+2j]

Tuple
A tuple is a collection of items which is ordered and unchangeable.
A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses ().
A tuple can contain items of different data types.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', [], 10.09, 12+2j)

The only difference between a tuple and a list is that a tuple is immutable.
