What is control flow?  
Control flow is the order in which individual statements,  
instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.  

Control flow determines how your program’s code executes from start to finish  
– it’s like a roadmap that tells the computer  
which path to take through your code. 






Examples of control flow statements are:  
1. Conditional Statements  
2. Loops  
3. Function calls  
4. Exception Handling  

Conditional Statements  
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in code.  
They allow the program to evaluate whether a condition is true or false.  
Then run the appropriateblock of code based on the result.
The master mind behind conditional statements is the if statement and also the key to execution of conditional statements is the boolean data type

it is also important to take note and understand indentation in python
indentation is a way of telling python that a block of code belongs together.
indentation is done using spaces or tabd usually after a colen (:) on a new line.

Here is a list of comparison operators in python
== equal to
!= Not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greayer than or equal to
<= less than or equal to


# Logical Operators in Python:
and  - Returns True if both conditions are True.
or   - Returns True if at least one condition is True.
not  - Reverses the logical state (True becomes False and vice versa).

# Arithmetic Operators in Python:
+   Addition
-   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
/   Division (returns float)
//  Floor division (returns integer)
%   Modulus (returns remainder)
**  Exponentiation (power)

USER INPUT
input() is a builtin function in python that
allows you to take input from the user
input () always returns a string
you can cast the input to a different data type
by using the appropriate data type information
int() , float() , str() , bool()

A function is a piece of reusable code





Parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

Arguments are the values passed to the function when it is called.
